# Rice Transcriptome Analysis: Normal and Drought Conditions Across 216 Accessions

This repository provides a comprehensive analysis of rice transcript expression variation under drought stress conditions. Using the extensive dataset from Groen et al. (2020, Nature), this Jupyter notebook investigates how specific rice transcripts respond to environmental stress. The analysis pipeline serves as a template for examining any transcript from the dataset, with three representative transcripts analyzed as case studies to demonstrate the methodology and biological insights.

## Dataset

Expression data from 216 rice accessions under wet and dry field conditions<br>
Normalized TPM (Transcripts Per Million) values from https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-1997-2<br>
Data downloaded from https://zenodo.org/records/3533431<br>
Covers major rice varietal groups (INDICA and JAPONICA).

## Requirements

### Python Packages
- `pandas` - Data manipulation and analysis
- `numpy` - Numerical computing
- `matplotlib` - Plotting and visualization
- `seaborn` - Statistical data visualization
- `scipy` - Scientific computing (for statistical tests)
- `jupyter` - Jupyter notebook environment

### Installation
```bash
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib seaborn scipy jupyter
```

## Usage

1. Clone this repository to your local machine
2. Ensure all required Python packages are installed
3. Download the dataset files from the Zenodo repository (links provided in notebook)
4. Place the data files in the same directory as the notebook:
   - `GroenProcessedExpressionCountData.csv`
   - `GroenProcessedExpressionCountMetadata.csv`
5. Open the Jupyter notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Selected_transcripts_expression_variation.ipynb
   ```
6. Run cells sequentially to reproduce the analysis
7. Modify the `target_transcript` variable to analyze different transcripts of interest

## Files

### Main Analysis
- `Selected_transcripts_expression_variation.ipynb` - Main analysis notebook with complete pipeline

### Data Files (to be downloaded)
- `GroenProcessedExpressionCountData.csv` - Expression count data matrix (transcripts Ã— samples)<br>
- `GroenProcessedExpressionCountMetadata.csv` - Sample metadata including treatment and varietal group information<br>
- `selected_transcripts.txt` - List of transcripts analyzed in this study

### Output Files (generated by notebook)
- `OS04T0379700-01_*.png` - Publication-quality figures<br>
- `OS04T0379700-01_top_responsive_accessions.csv` - Summary table of most responsive accessions

## Analysis Pipeline:

Baseline Expression Variation: Quantifies natural genetic variation in transcript expression under normal (wet) conditions<br>
Drought Response Analysis: Compares expression changes between wet and dry treatments<br>
Statistical Testing: Mann-Whitney U tests and paired t-tests for group comparisons<br>
Varietal Group Comparisons: Analyzes differential responses between INDICA and JAPONICA rice varieties

## Visualizations:

Expression distribution histograms and box plots<br>
Statistical significance annotations with p-values<br>
Box and violin plots showing expression distributions<br>
Scatter plots of treatment responses<br>
Paired comparison plots showing individual accession responses

## Key Findings:

Identifies most responsive rice accessions to drought stress<br>
Quantifies fold-change responses and statistical significance<br>
Reveals varietal group-specific expression patterns<br>
Generates summary tables of top responsive accessions
